# Analyzing American Baby Name Trends

How have American baby name tastes changed since 1920? Which names have remained popular for over 100 years, and how do those names compare to more recent top baby names? These are considerations for many new parents. 

In this project, I'm exploring data on baby names provided by the United States Social Security Administration, which spans 101 years, from 1920 through 2020. It contains first names along with the number and sex of babies they were given to each year.

## Project highlights:

- Which names have remained popular throughout the whole period?
- Classification of names by their popularity.
- Rank of girls' names by the number of times they have been given.
- Exploring the rise of the name "Olivia".
- What are the most popular boys' names in each year? 
- Which boys' names have stayed most popular the longest?

Techniques used to answer the project questions include ranking, grouping, joining, ordering, pattern matching, conditions, window functions, subqueries and CTEs.

The project is done using **PostgreSQL** inside Jupyter Notebook.
